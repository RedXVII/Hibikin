    <h1>Wait ... What ? ...</h1>
    <h3>What is this and why ?</h3>
    <p>Hibikin is a chrome extension allowing you to define on which folders your downloads should be saved by default. If you are tired of your Downloads folder being a mess, this is for you !</p>
    <h3>So how does it work ?</h3>
    <p>Define rules for each of your folders. Now when downloading a file that matches those rules, the file will be automatically in the right folder !</p>
    <h3>Rules ? ...</h3>
    <p>For instance, you might want all the .exe in a "Programs" folder, for that, just define a rule that says "Ends with" ".exe" !
    If you wanna save funny pictures from your favorite website in a "funny" folder, use the "Begins with" rule with the url of your website.
    For people with more precise needs, you can directly use regexps.</p>
    <h3>I want to save it in THIS folder !</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, you can only save in folders that are inside your Downloads folder. This is set by Google due to security reasons.</p>
    <h3>Why is there an order for the rules and why does it matter ?</h3>
    <p>You might have a rule to save all gifs in a "gif" folder. And a rule to save all pictures from imgur on a "imgur" folder.
    In that case, if you save a gif from imgur, only the first rule found will be applied. Which is why order matters.</p>
    <h3>The hell are regexps ??</h3>
    <p>Something that was invented a long time ago to match string of characters. You can find out how to use it <a href="http://regexone.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
    <h3>I'm still confused !</h3>
    <p>Eat a Persim berry. Or send me a mail at pierre.flores17@gmail.com !</p>
    <h3>Why is there an anime chick ? How is it related to this extension ?</h3>
    <p>I just like it.</p>
